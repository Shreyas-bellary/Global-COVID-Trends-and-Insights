# üåç Global COVID Trends and Insights üìä

Welcome to **Global COVID Trends and Insights**, a data-driven project that delves into the evolving trends of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using cutting-edge technologies, this project extracts, cleans, and analyzes global COVID-19 data to provide actionable insights on various key metrics such as stringency, GDP per capita, vaccination effectiveness, and much more.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This repository offers a comprehensive analysis of the global COVID-19 landscape. By leveraging powerful tools like **Python** and **Jupyter Notebooks**, we‚Äôve cleaned the raw data, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and uncovered breakthrough insights. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the pandemic, including its economic and social impact, and offer predictive insights to help decision-makers navigate ongoing challenges.

## üìä Key Data Insights

- **Stringency vs. GDP Per Capita**: During the pandemic, it wasn‚Äôt a country‚Äôs GDP that determined its success in managing the crisis, but how well it utilized its resources. Nations with efficient healthcare and resource management, regardless of their economic standing, navigated the pandemic more effectively. Conversely, even wealthier nations faced challenges if their resources were poorly managed, highlighting that strategic action outweighed economic power.

- **Vaccination Success**: Countries with higher vaccination rates show a marked decrease in infection and mortality rates. This emphasizes the importance of vaccination campaigns and their long-term effectiveness in preventing severe outcomes.

- **Mortality Analysis**: Using historical data, we calculated the **average time for COVID-related death** post-infection. On average, infected individuals who did not survive the virus passed away between **16-17 days** after initial infection, reaching extremely close average values to the actual value, as indicated by the data. Thus, providing critical timing for interventions.

- **Global Trends**: We observed shifting global hotspots with the virus evolving differently across regions. Trends showcase how COVID waves moved geographically.

## üí° Future Work

This analysis sets the stage for future research, such as:

- Predictive modeling of future COVID waves based on historical data trends. 
- A deeper dive into the economic impact of prolonged lockdowns on specific sectors. 
- Ongoing tracking of emerging variants and their effects on infection and mortality rates.
